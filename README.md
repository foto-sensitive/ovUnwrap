#ovUnwrap

The challenge of showing 360° video is its warped perspective. The footage encompasses everything around it, this app offers a way to unwrap and exhibit these panoramic shots. I developed several prototypes in openFrameworks to playback these videos and allow the user to navigate across them until ultimately deciding to unwrap them spherically around a gluSphere object and by viewing it from inside.

## Usage
Drag & drop videos and  pictures  onto the
window to unwrap 360° media. Drag the mouse
across the screen to look around.


## Dependencies:
### Library itself
None (C++11)

### Examples
openFrameworks 0.9.0

should work on any platform, but project files currently exist only for Windows / VS2015
