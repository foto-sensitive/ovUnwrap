#ovUnwrap

The challenge of showing 360° video is its warped perspective which encompasses everything around it. This app offers a way to unwrap and exhibit these panoramic shots in a regular first person view. The sketch is part of a series of 360° utility examples I made in openFrameworks, they are distinguished by the 'ov' (omni-vid) prefix.

## Usage
Drag & drop videos and  pictures  onto the
window to unwrap 360° media. Drag the mouse
across the screen to look around.

### Library itself

openFrameworks 0.9.0

None (C++11)
